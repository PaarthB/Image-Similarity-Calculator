# Image-Similarity-Checker
Checks how much percentage of a hollow shape does a solid image correctly fit/resemble
- Uses Python 3.x, OpenCV 3 for python and ImageMagick
- The hollow image and the solid image have same shapes, but can be of different sizes and orientation. The program takes care of that by resizing and de-skewing and also removes noise in both the images if any.
